<div className="aboutpage__content">

Quick links to <AnchorLink to="/getting-started" title="Getting started guide" /> and <AnchorLink to="/docs" title="documention" />.

When I start something new I always find 1000 things I have to do before...

Prep work, you know...

I think I've started working on this Gatsby Starter, because I wanted to start blogging

Yes, I could have taken one of many great Gatsby starters (and actually start blogging)

But instead I've decided to spend countless hours working on my own starter

Which of course had to be different (otherwise, what would be the point of doing it?)

Anyways

Here it is:

## Developers Dream Gatsby Starter

Self-proclaimed dream starter for my Gatsby projects.

Yes, I've build it for myself.

But you can use it too.

For you I've created <AnchorLink to="/getting-started" title="Getting started guide" /> and <AnchorLink to="/docs" title="documention" />.

Yes, just for you (and my future self)

## Goals

1. Strongly typed
2. Ready to use shortcodes
3. Optimized Images
4. Flexibilty as a Developer
5. Flexibilty as a blogger
6. SEO
