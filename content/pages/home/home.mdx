<div className="homepage__content">

"Developers Dream" At least this is what I thought..

When I first started working on this Gatsby Starter a year ago...

After a 10 months break I've picked it up again and...

It's actually not far off.

I had to update almost every dependency.

Some of them, including Gatsby, updated their major version.

Despite that, the update went smooth.

And I was up and running in no time.

Now it's time for me to finish it up, so other developers can use it.
