Funny as it sounds, this is a peace of code (no, not even a peace of code, just Markdown), that you shouldn't delete.
If you delete this file you might face some errors.
GraphQL required to have at least one occurance of a particular frontmatter field (among all posts and pages)
So let's say that none of your posts or pages has a `featuredImage` field in their frontmatter. That would break the build.
Try it if you don't believe me.
